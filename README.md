# Youtube-DL-Helper
Simple CLI script to make the use of Youtube-DL easier.
Special thanks to [@Foxydiot](https://github.com/foxydiot) for coming up with the part that downloads FFmpeg and Youtube-DL in case they are missing.
(He is working on a version of himself, based on version 1.0)

This script has been made to just ease up the use of Youtube-DL. On itself, it is just a CLI app where you need to enter a lot of little arguments and stuff..
But we are lazy! So why not automate (most of) it?!

## Requirements
- Windows 10 or Higher (due to cURL)
- Reasonably fast internet if you don't wanna wait too long for your downloads :)

## Known Problems
- Nothing, you tell me :)
