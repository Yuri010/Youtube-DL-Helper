# Youtube-DL-Helper
Simple CLI script to make the use of Youtube-DL easier.
Special thanks to [@BennoMP](https://github.com/bennomp) for coming up with the part that downloads FFmpeg and Youtube-DL in case they are missing.
(He is working on a version of himself, based on version 1.0)

This script has been made to just ease up the use of Youtube-DL. On itself, it is just a CLI app where you need to enter a lot of little arguments and stuff..
But we are lazy! So why not automate (most of) it?!

## Known Problems
- Video downloads in low quality (for example 640x480 instead of the highest quality available) ([#1](https://github.com/Yuri010/Youtube-DL-Helper/issues/1))
- Nothing else, you tell me :)
